# MicroLlama-300M

</div>

As an individual with limited access and compute, I have been wondering if I could build a decent large-language model for a while. As the big mega corporations are focused on getting bigger and bigger models, I am going small! 

<div align="center">
  <img src="./microllama.jpg" width="300"/>
</div>

As a result, I set up the following goals to **pretraining** a **300M Llama model** with the following restrictions:

1. My overall budget is $500.
2. Must pretrain an LLM from scratch with a fully open-source dataset and model.
3. Not allowed to finetune a model or use another LLM such as GPT-4 to generate any training data.

This project is heavily based on [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama), which is an awesome open-source project aimed to **pretraining** a **1.1.1B Llama model on 1T tokens**. 

This project is work in progress. Currently, I have spent \$280 on compute using 4 x Nvidia 4090 on [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai) and \$3 on AWS S3 storage after 4 days of training of the **300M Llama model** with **50B** tokens.

I modified [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama) to support the following features (I will release my forked version of the source code after some clean up):
1. Pretrain a smaller size 300M model on [Slimpajama](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cerebras/slimpajama-627b)
2. Removed [Starcoderdata](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/starcoderdata) so that my model can focus on [Slimpajama](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cerebras/slimpajama-627b). This also means my model probably cannot do coding without fine-tuning.
3. Added the ability to process and tokenize [Slimpajama](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cerebras/slimpajama-627b) while downloading the data. The original setup only works with pre-downloaded data. This turns out to be a good time-saver because downloading 800G+ of data on a non-commercial Internet is very slow, and processing all of [Slimpajama](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cerebras/slimpajama-627b) data also takes time.
4. Various helper scripts and Python code such as python code for uploading the pretrained checkpoint to the huggingface hub.
5. Bug fixes.

## News and Updates

**08/10/2025** - Released [MicroLaVa](https://github.com/keeeeenw/MicroLlava), a lightweight Visual Q&A model based on [TinyLLaVA_Factory](https://github.com/TinyLLaVA/TinyLLaVA_Factory). The [MicroLaVa](https://github.com/keeeeenw/MicroLlava) model contains only 700M parameters in total and can be pre-trained and fine-tuned on a single Nvidia RTX 4090. Built on MicroLlama, it already produces meaningful results with further improvements planned.

**11/10/2024** - Published [MicroLlama-text-embedding](https://huggingface.co/keeeeenw/MicroLlama-text-embedding/), a compact text embedding model for sentence similarity tasks. Based on MicroLlama architecture, this model is in active development and requires further optimization.

**06/04/2024** - MicroLlama became officially supported in [LitGPT](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/litgpt). Thanks to the Lightning AI team for accepting my [merge request](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/litgpt/pull/1457) and providing Lightning AI Studio credits.


## Evaluation results

I performed the experiment using the standard [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) setup. Following the same setup as [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama), I used **acc_norm** for all datasets except for **winogrande** and **boolq** which used **acc** as the metrics.

1. **[keeeeenw/MicroLlama](https://huggingface.co/keeeeenw/MicroLlama)** is the evaluation results for my **300M Llama model on 50B tokens**.
2. **[google-best/bert-large-uncased](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-large-uncased)** is the baseline because it is one of the most popular small LLMs and it has a similar parameter count of **336M**.
3. **[PY007/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v0.1)** as a sanity check I perform evaluation against one of the [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama) models to validate my setup for [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). These numbers are exactly the same as the ones reported by [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama).
4. **TinyLlama-1.1B-intermediate-step-1431k-3T** is evaluation result for the best model created and reported by [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama).

To reproduce my numbers, please install [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) and run the following command:
```bash
lm_eval \
    --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=keeeeenw/MicroLlama,dtype="float",tokenizer=TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-step-50K-105b \
    --tasks hellaswag,openbookqa,winogrande,arc_easy,arc_challenge,boolq,piqa \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size 64
```

#### Observations
1. Because [keeeeenw/MicroLlama](https://huggingface.co/keeeeenw/MicroLlama) is much smaller than [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama), our model does not achieve the same impressive results but the numbers are closer than I expected.
2. Our model outperforms [google-best/bert-large-uncased](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-large-uncased) which is actually slightly larger. The only dataset that [google-best/bert-large-uncased](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-large-uncased) outperformed our model is ARC_c (arc_challenge). I will provide more analysis as future study.

Based on the evaluation above, our model should be a good starting point for fine-tunning tasks that are typically performed using the BERT family of models. Some of tasks may include
1. (sentence transformer)[https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers], 
2. (bertscore)[https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/bertscore]
3. A light-weight chatbot after some finetuning.
